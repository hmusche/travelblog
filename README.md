Simple Blog for our upcoming world journey

Currently a dump of the SQL database is needed if you'd want
to spin up an installation of this. A DB installer and updater
is on the timeline.

The JS relies on logic supplied by MooTools, and uses MapBox
to display a map for geolocationed blog posts. A valid key is
needed in the config. The goal is to get rid of all frameworks
(namely jQuery and MooTools).
